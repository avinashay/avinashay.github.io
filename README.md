## Welcome
Hello, and welcome to my section of this website! My name is Avinash, and I am a graduate student currently pursuing my Masters degree in Robotics at Northeastern university. As a student of robotics, computer vision, and deep learning, my academic and professional interests lie in the intersection of these fields. I am passionate about exploring the ways in which these technologies can be combined and leveraged to solve complex problems, such as improving automation or enhancing safety and navigation in autonomous systems.
